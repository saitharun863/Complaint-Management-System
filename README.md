# Complaint-Management-System
Here, We have a CMS which works on XAMPP server with SQL database(internally present in XAMPP)
we have used PHP,JavaScript,HTML,CSS in order to built this system.
Beginning with 'login authentication' to 'Filing and viewing a complaint'.
Host and Server present on same system. Can be modified to multiple by making the database central and using APIs.
NOTE: NO APIs are used, Simple and Easy.

First of all you should have cms database,
For sure you need to have tables named:(for this project,i havent used i after f in verif 'i' cation)
adminverifcation(aloginid1,apassword1)
studentverifcation(sloginid1,spassword1)
complaints(ID,subject,description,created_at,status)

use some default data for autentication as:
adminverifcation
 ______________________________
|  aloginid1   |   apassword1  |
|______________|______________ |
|   admin123   |   12345678    |
