# Complaint-Management-System
Here, We have a CMS which works on XAMPP server with SQL database(internally present in XAMPP)
we have used PHP,JavaScript,HTML,CSS in order to built this system.
Beginning with 'login authentication' to 'Filing and viewing a complaint'.
Host and Server present on same system. Cam be modified to multiple by making the database central and using APIs.
NOTE: NO APIs are used, Simple and Easy.
